### Project Synopsis

Bloc's API provides an external facing JSON Web Token authorized gateway to the Bloc application. It can be accessed via cURL, but an API client can manage the low-level details of making requests and handling responses. Build the Kele API Client to provide easy access to and use of the student endpoints of Bloc's API.
